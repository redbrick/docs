# Aperture

## What is Aperture?

It's nothing to do with cameras. See [about](about.md) for more information on the hardware.

## New Admins

If you're a new admin, this is a cheat sheet for you. In order to get broadly up to speed and understand the content of these pages, I suggest you read the following:

- [About](about.md)
- [Nomad docs](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/), specifically the [job specification](https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/docs/job-specification) and [managing nomad jobs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/tutorials/manage-jobs) pages.
- [Consul docs](https://www.consul.io/docs), specifically how it can be used with Nomad.
- [Ansible docs](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html), specifically the [playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks.html)
