# Committee Handover

When a new committee is elected, there are many things to hand over. This is a list of those things.

## Passwords

All passwords should be rotated as soon as possible. This is to ensure that passwords are rotated, and that the old
committee can no longer access Redbrick using the old passwords. The passwords are stored in Bitwarden, and the master
password should be rotated first and foremost.

## 2-Factor Authentication

The Chair holds the 2FA key for the Bitwarden account.
