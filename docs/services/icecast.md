# Icecast

Icecast is a streaming server that we currently host on aperture.

We stream DCUFm's Broadcasts to their apps via a stream presented on `dcufm.redbrick.dcu.ie`.

## Procedure

The configuration file for icecast is located in the [nomad config repo](https://github.com/redbrick/nomad).

It should just be a case of running `nomad job plan clubs-socs/dcufm.hcl` to plan and run the job.

> [!NOTE] Note
> The job may bind to either the internal or external address. Ensure that if you make a change to the config, you inform DCUfm that they may need to switch which server they use.

## Streaming to Icecast

DCUfm use [butt](https://danielnoethen.de/butt/) on a desktop in their studio to stream to Icecast.

The desktop must be connected to the VPN to ensure the stream stays up, and traefik doesn't reset the connection every 10 seconds. The current icecast configuration for the server is `10.10.0.5:2333` or `136.206.16.5:2333` (see above note).

Read more about it in [this issue](https://github.com/redbrick/issue-tracker/issues/4).

A shortcut to the VPN is available on the desktop (change a shortcut to the binary to include `--connect profile.ovpn`.

See [here](https://munkjensen.net/wiki/index.php/Connect_OpenVPN_on_Windows_startup)).

## DCUfm Cheat Sheet

This is a cheat sheet for DCUfm to help them stream to `icecast`.

### Connecting to the VPN

You'll need to connect to the Redbrick VPN to stream to `icecast`. You can do this by double clicking the shortcut on the desktop.

You'll then need to go to bottom right corner of the screen and right click this icon:

![Disconnected OpenVPN icon](https://i.dbyte.xyz/2022-11-I9.png)

A popup will appear, click connect. This will connect you to the VPN. It may take a second, but a window will pop up with a lot of text. The VPN will connect and then it'll close.

You should end up with an icon like this:

![Connected OpenVPN icon](https://i.dbyte.xyz/2022-11-16.png)

You're now connected to the VPN.

### Connecting to Icecast

You'll need to connect to `icecast` to stream to it. BUTT is the software we use to stream to `icecast`. You'll also find this on the desktop. Once its open, (and you're connected to the VPN), press the small "play" button in the top left corner. This will start your stream to the server.

The username and password should already be configured in the software. If not, ask a [redbrick sysadmin](../contact.md) for the login details.

> [!WARNING] Warning!
> If you find that butt is not connecting, then you may need to switch which server you're connecting to. To do this, go to settings, and then the "Main" tab. In the dropdown, select either DCUfm 1 or DCUfm 2 (try both, one will definitely work).

### Saving Your Stream

Your stream will be saved automatically onto the desktop into a folder called `Recordings YYYY` (where `YYYY` is the current year), with the date and time of the recording, and the format `.mp3`. Take this file with you (via a USB or similar) if you want to keep it for later, it will not be kept on the desktop for long!

### Further Information

If you have any questions, please ask a [redbrick sysadmin](../contact.md).
