# Blockbot

Blockbot is a Discord bot, written in Python, that is maintained by the Redbrick Webgroup. This project uses [`hikari`](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/), an opinionated microframework, to interface with the Discord API. [`hikari-arc`](https://github.com/hypergonial/hikari-arc) is the command handler and [`hikari-miru`](https://github.com/hypergonial/hikari-miru) is the component handler of choice.

## File Structure

All bot files are under `src/`.

- `bot.py`
    - Contains the bot configuration and instantiation (e.g. loading the bot extensions).
- `extensions/`
    - Contains extensions (files) that are loaded when the bot is started. Extensions are a way to split bot logic across multiple files, commonly used to group different features. Extensions can contain plugins, command, event listeners and other logic. [Read more](https://arc.hypergonial.com/guides/plugins_extensions/).
- `examples/`
    - Contains example extensions with commands, components and more as reference for developers.
- `config.py`
    - Configuration secrets and important constants (such as identifiers) are stored here. The secrets are loaded from environment variables, so you can set them in your shell or in a `.env` file.
- `utils.py`
    - Utility functions are stored here, that can be reused across the codebase.

## Installation

> [!TIP]
> Docker Compose for local development is highly reccommended. This is similar to how it is deployed on Redbrick.

### Discord Developer Portal

As a prerequisite, you need to have an application registered on the Discord developer portal.

1. Create a Discord application [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).
2. Go to *"OAuth2 > URL Generator"* on the left sidebar, select the `bot` and `applications.commands` scopes, and then select the bot permissions you need (for development, you can select `Administrator`).
3. Go to the generated URL and invite the application to the desired server.

#### Bot Token

1. Open the application on the Discord developer portal.
2. Go to *"Bot"* on the left sidebar, click `Reset Token`.
3. Copy the newly generated token.

### Source Code

1. `git clone` and `cd` into the [blockbot repository](https://github.com/redbrick/blockbot).
2. It is generally advised to work in a Python [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html):

    ```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Rename `.env.sample` to `.env` inside the repo folder and fill in the environment variables with your secrets. e.g.:

    ```
    TOKEN=<Discord bot token here>
    ```

4. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required packages.
5. Start the bot by running `python3 -m src`.

### Docker

1. `git clone` and `cd` into this repository.
2. Create a new file called `.env` inside the repo folder and paste your bot token into the file as such:
```
TOKEN=<Discord bot token here>
```
3. Build the docker image `docker build --tag "blockbot-testing" .`
4. Run this image `docker run "blockbot-testing"`

### Docker Compose
1. `git clone` and `cd` into this repository.
2. Create a new file called `.env` inside the repo folder and paste your bot token into the file as such:
```
TOKEN=<Discord bot token here>
```
3. Run the docker-compose.yml file `docker-compose up -d`

## What's the difference between `hikari`, `hikari-arc` and `hikari-miru`?

* `hikari` -  the Discord API wrapper. Can be used to, for example:
    * [add roles to server members](https://docs.hikari-py.dev/en/stable/reference/hikari/api/rest/#hikari.api.rest.RESTClient.add_role_to_member)
    * [create threads](https://docs.hikari-py.dev/en/stable/reference/hikari/api/rest/#hikari.api.rest.RESTClient.create_thread)
    * [send individual messages](https://docs.hikari-py.dev/en/stable/reference/hikari/api/rest/#hikari.api.rest.RESTClient.create_message)
    * [fetch guild (server) information](https://docs.hikari-py.dev/en/stable/reference/hikari/api/rest/#hikari.api.rest.RESTClient.fetch_guild)
    * update member roles ([add role](https://docs.hikari-py.dev/en/stable/reference/hikari/api/rest/#hikari.api.rest.RESTClient.add_role_to_member), [remove role](https://docs.hikari-py.dev/en/stable/reference/hikari/api/rest/#hikari.api.rest.RESTClient.remove_role_from_member), [edit roles](https://docs.hikari-py.dev/en/stable/reference/hikari/api/rest/#hikari.api.rest.RESTClient.edit_member))
    * listen for events from Discord, like [message edits](https://docs.hikari-py.dev/en/stable/reference/hikari/events/message_events/#hikari.events.message_events.MessageUpdateEvent)
* `hikari-arc` - the command handler. Can be used to:
    * create application commands ([slash](https://arc.hypergonial.com/guides/options/#declaring-options), [message & user commands](https://arc.hypergonial.com/guides/context_menu/))
    * respond to command interactions
* `hikari-miru` - the component handler. Can be used to:
    * create message components (buttons, select menus & modals)
    * respond to component interactions (button clicks, select menu selections & modal submissions)

## Why use a `hikari.GatewayBot` instead of a `hikari.RESTBot`?

**TL;DR:** `RESTBot`s do not receive events required for some blockbot features (e.g. starboard), so `GatewayBot` must be used instead.

`GatewayBot`s connect to Discord via a websocket, and Discord sends events (including interactions) through this websocket. `RESTBot`s run a web server which Discord sends only interactions to (not events) via HTTP requests. These events are required for specific blockbot features, like starboard (which uses reaction create/remove events).

## What's the difference between `hikari.GatewayBot`, `arc.GatewayClient` and `miru.Client`?

* `hikari.GatewayBot` is the actual Discord bot. It:
    * manages the websocket connection to Discord
    * sends HTTP requests to the Discord REST API
    * caches information received in events sent by Discord
* `arc.GatewayClient` adds additional functionality to `hikari.GatewayBot` for:
    * splitting the bot across multiple files using [extensions](https://arc.hypergonial.com/guides/plugins_extensions/#extensions)
    * grouping commands using [plugins](https://arc.hypergonial.com/guides/plugins_extensions/#plugins)
    * easily creating and managing commands and [command groups](https://arc.hypergonial.com/guides/command_groups/)
    * accessing objects globally (in any extension, plugin or command) using [dependency injection](https://arc.hypergonial.com/guides/dependency_injection/) (e.g. a database connection)
* `miru.Client` adds additional functionality to `hikari.GatewayBot` for:
    * creating message components using [views](https://miru.hypergonial.com/getting_started/#first-steps)
    * creating [modals](https://miru.hypergonial.com/guides/modals/)
    * creating [navigators](https://miru.hypergonial.com/guides/navigators/) and [menus](https://miru.hypergonial.com/guides/menus/) using views

## Do's and Don'ts

* Always try to get data from the cache before fetching it from the API.
